# Hiring Processes
## Austin Putman, @austinfromboston

???

My name is Austin Putman, I'm VP of Engineering at Omada Health.  We're 
working in Ruby, Rails, Coffeescript, iOS and Android to create a
new model of digital therapeutics.  Our first product,
is Prevent, at preventnow.com. It helps people with prediabetes lower their risk of developing type 2 diabetes.  Our goal is that doctors reach for
preventative interventions before they reach for a prescription pad.

And it is awesome.

---
## That Don't Waste Time

???

Let's get started right away.  We're here to talk about hiring, a
subject that is near and dear to my heart.  We'll talk a little bit
about recruiting, but the heart of this talk is about how to evaluate a
candidate effectively and sell them on your company at the same time.

---

## What makes a good candidate?


???

A good candidate is someone who will add value to your team.
A great candidate is someone who will transform your team.

If we are honest with ourselves, once we have a set team culture, and
that culture is productive, we are
rarely eager for it to be transformed.  Which is why it is a waste of
time to look for "rock stars" when we really want solid, productive
team players.

What makes a good candidate depends on your project and your existing
team, but you should take the time to list out what really matters to
you. Here's my list.

---

## Experience with your key technologies

???

A good candidate has experience with your key technologies.

Of all the qualifications a candidate can have, this is the most
negotiable.

---

## Experience (optional)

???

Any self-taught engineer knows that it is possible to create a viable project using an unfamiliar technology.  The code will almost certainly be wrong and
nightmarish to maintain.

And it may take longer than it would with an
experienced coder, 

but it is possible to do it if you are willing to accept these
risks.

In many cases, Getting a veteran or a protege to learn your technology may be the best
option you've got.  How fast they can learn is something you need to
find out during the interview.

---

## Experience (your burn rate)

???

If your candidate is experienced in your technology, you'll want to find
out how deep their experience runs. 

If your work is in Rails, work with
them in Rails. or whatever your technology is, whether that's objective-C, or assembler.

Point is, in today's tech market, you are paying a premium for
experience in a particular technology, and you want to know that you are
getting your money's worth.


---

## Solid communication skills

???

Everyone values good communication.

But how does communication happen in your team?  Is it via Slack or IRC?

Is it in-person standups and shoulder-tapping?  During the interview, you want to see how your candidate uses these tools.  

Put them in the IRC channel during the
interview.  See how and when they ask for help if you give them a
problem to work on in isolation.

Most importantly, how do you and your team mates feel about
communicating with this candidate?  

Good communicators in a stressful interview environment will still be
able to form bonds with their evaluators. These bonds are the seeds of
trust, and trust is what builds a team.

---

## Takes joy in solving (your) problems

???

Good developers enjoy their work at a personal level.

That's one reason many excellent coders put in so much overtime --
solving problems is an addictive process.  For some folks, coding is 
like playing a video game that produces tangible results.

An sensitive evaluator should be able to tell the difference between a
candidate who is doing what is required for the interview and one who is
actually interested in the problem being worked on.

Take advantage of this by sharing real work from your project
with candidates.  It could be on an abandoned branch, but give them the
chance to see the scope of the problems they'll be working on in the
day-to-day.  That way when they accept your offer, they know what
they're signing up for.

---

## Takes joy in learning

???

Many coders, myself included, love showing what they can do and struggle when they get outside their comfort zone.  

Take the opportunity to observe the candidate working in a foreign environment.  

Simply having to learn something about your codebase is a place to start.  

You might also try a kata screen using a language they don't know, we'll
talk more about that later.

---


## Wants to work on your team

???

The other key thing about a good candidate is that they are looking for
you.  

And you should have a process that puts your best assets forward.  Maybe
you have a truly game changing technology, or can bid higher than anyone else.
But probably not.

In today's talent market, unless you work for one of the major players,
you can't afford to compete on price.  People will choose your company
because they like the coworkers and the leaders and they enjoy the
culture within the office.

---
# Empathy

???

Finally, a good candidate naturally develops an emotional connection to
the people around them and wants to help them with their problems.  This
is gonna make thing with your project manager, your business
stakeholders, and your customers work better.

Most importantly, this will help you when it comes time to recruit
additional members to your team, and it will help you train and mentor
those people.


---

## Finding good candidates

???

Once you know what you're looking for, how do you go about finding these people?

As an engineer with ten years of experience, I've gone through many interviews that I failed.

I've talked to many others who have had the same experience.  People
often don't look for new jobs because they hate the interview process.

With a market this tight, that's just silly.

Let's do a quick rundown of common practices and their problems.

---

## Contingency recruiters

???

There are good recruiters out there, but the incentives are lined up
against employers.  These folks are motivated to either spam you or
ignore you if you aren't responsive to spam.  

Their incentives are with the candidates, not with the employers.  You
may make a good hire or two from them, but using them extensively is not strategic, not to mention expensive.

---

## Technical phone screens
### (antipattern)

???

So the recruiter has sent you a candidate.  

You can't waste engineers'
time on every candidate, so maybe you have a set of pre-set questions that your HR
team asks when deciding whether or not a candidate is worth your time.

Unfortunately, talking about code over the phone is almost intrinsically
terrible.  And telling a non-coder about the pull-requests you've had
accepted on a useful gem is boring at dinner parties and equally
awful in interviews.

---

## Whiteboard coding

???

Assuming they handled a multiple choice phone screen, now you bring them
to a room with a whiteboard to demonstrate that they can write code.
You'll give them FizzBuzz, or implementing a queue, or fibonacci, and
then ask them for arbitrary optimizations.  This
will demonstrate whether they were paying attention in CS 201 and 301,
as well as how good their penmanship is.

The thing is, writing code on a whiteboard is orders of magnitude slower
than doing it on a computer.  You learn nothing about their typing speed
or what tools they like to use.  If you take nothing else from this
talk, move your whiteboard exercise onto a computer.  Use a projector
and two keyboards so that your interviewer can play along.

Moving the technical exercise off the whiteboard gives you more
information and more options.  You can see how your candidate organizes
their code.  You can provide malfunctioning code and see how they
improve it.  You can even run tests.

More importantly, you can get a glimpse of how your candidate handles
complexity.  Dealing with complexity well is one thing that
distinguishes a senior engineer.

---

## The Gauntlet

???

After a candidate goes through one technical exercise, they often have
to do another with another interviewer.  Some teams want every person to
sign off before a hire.

As a candidate, this is an awful experience.  

Building up a rapport with an interviewer is significant work and by the 3rd set of folks they're pretty tired.  

Definitely get 2 opinions on the technical screen.  If you need more
than that, have a 2nd interview round and let the candidate get some
sleep.

---

## The Gang-Up

???

Sometimes, to save time, you'll have a panel do the technical interview.

This one-on-many dynamic is naturally adversarial, just ask anyone who's been
through Senate confirmation hearings.  

You're creating an environment for a performance, rather than evaluating the quality of the person's work.  

What do you get if you optimize your interview process for people who
enjoy showing off?

---

# What am I missing?

???

Rather than optimizing for folks who have read the "how to crack the
google interview" book and are great at performing in adversarial
situations, 

I want an interview process that shows me how quickly folks
will learn my stack, that they are deeply interested in my problems, and
that they'll be able to form meaningful relationships with the other people
on the team.

---

# How To 

???

These are my aspirations for how to build a recruiting pipeline right.

---

## Trust your recruiter

???

Get a recruiter who works for you, rather than being paid by
commission. This can be a contract or full-time role.

There's a new service called RecruitLoop if you aren't big enough to afford a full or part-time position for handling this.  

We got a business team intern who at least handled screening the resumes
that come from the contingency recruiters.  

In any case, put someone between you and the constant spam that comes from the recruiting industry.

---

## Have Lovable Phone Screens

???

In the phone screen, the key question that needs to be answered is 
"do I want to spend eight hours with this person?".  

This is a short stop on the long
hike to answering "Do I want to spend the next year with this person?"

The person on the other end of the phone is asking the
same question.  This is your first impression on them and sets up
whether your company is in the running to be their first choice.

Every team has people who help define their culture.  As a hiring
manager, it may be you.

If someone else comes to mind, have that person do some
phone screens. Start figuring out cultural fit early and let the other
person know what you're about. 

---

## Phone screen checklist

- Do I want to spend a workday with this person?
- Able to communicate clearly about their work?
- Wants to do the job we need done?
- Am I likely to hire this candidate?

???

Have a checklist of questions so your evaluators are clear about what
they're looking for.

Here's mine, and as you can see it's half gut-check questions.  Is
pushing this candidate through the process a good use of my time and
theirs?  It's not worth it to me to hire someone if my gut tells me I
shouldn't.

How do I find out if someone wants to do the job we need done?

I usually ask a question like "what role are you really looking for in
your next gig?".  You'd be amazed how many people tell me it is their
dream to be a product person.  And I want them to achieve that dream.
So I don't hire them.

---

## Fast, Relevant Technical Screening

???

Pivotal has a terrific process for fast technical screening called the RPI, for "Rob Pairing Interview".

Rob is the CEO, but the RPI is performed by managers at many levels. It
takes less than an hour, and at the end you're usually told immediate
whether you should come back for an in-depth interview.

The RPI is a pairing exercise where the candidate is not allowed to type, they
just look over the evaluator's shoulder and suggest how to approach a
problem.  Because they aren't typing, they don't even have to be
familiar with the language being used.  If they've seen curly braces
before, they'll be able to handle the code.

The problem Pivotal uses is to implement a basic data structure from
scratch.

---

## Kata screens

???

I'm calling this 'kata screening', because the evaluator should practice
the exercise many times before using it.  You can start by pairing with every
existing member of your team, to get a sense of the levels you already
have.

---
## Fast technical screens

- Evaluator must have deep familiarity
- Candidate shouldn't need to know the tools
- Pairing

???

Fast relevant technical screening should have the following traits:

- Evaluator should have deep familiarity with the problem
- Candidate should not have to be familiar with the language/tools being
  used in advance.  
- Pairing allows the interviewer to control the duration of the
exercise, and gather enough information to evaluate well. 

---

## The output is the work

???

There is a key difference between this approach and the problem-set
approach of a service like interview street.  
Brain teasers look at the outcome of
their work.  

You want to be in the room with them, observing their way
of working, what they are looking up, and how they interact while they
work.  

---

## In-depth Technical Assessments

???

So your candidate has passed a kata screen.  Now you want to know how
deep a person's skill goes.  In my case this helps me gauge how much to
pay them.

The only reliable means of thoroughly evaluating the skill of a programmer is to use a better programmer.  You want to know how long it will take your
candidate to come up to speed, as well as how they get along with your
existing team.

We handle this via a daylong pairing interview.  Basically, it is their
first day of work.  They show up for morning standup, spend the morning pairing 
with one person and
the afternoon pairing with another, and go to lunch with the rest of the
team.  At five o'clock the hiring manager asks how their day went and if
they have any questions that are still unanswered.

A whole day is a lot of time.  But in that 5 o'clock conversation, it
is usually crystal clear whether the candidate wants to work for us or
not.  Which reduces the time I spend negotiating with folks who are
trying to play me off against a preferred employer.

---

## Do real work

???

We have our candidates do real work from our backlog.  We try to find
stories that don't require them to understand the entire stack.

Especially for senior candidates, though, watching them go after a bug
in an unknown codebase is a beatiful thing to behold.

It also means that interviews don't completely kill our productivity.
It is possible for interviews to actually produce usable code, though
most don't.

---

### Evaluating your candidate

???

At the end of a half-day of pairing, the interviewers are left with a
mess of impressions.  The social ones are important, as are the
technical details.  

To help them sort through it, we use a quantitative
evaluation that also supplies room for anecdotes.  

After they've made their ratings, they are asked to recommend for or
against hiring.  A 'No' from any evaluator blocks the hire.  A 'Not
Sure' from any evaluator is probably a 'No'.

---

## What we evaluate

- Technical Process
- Technical Skill
- Communication
- Leadership

???

We ask the evaluator to consider how the candidate works, what they
already know, how effective they are in communicating, and whether they
have leadership qualities that would be useful to the team.  It's a set
of about 25 questions on a scale of 1-4.

---

## Evaluating in a new technology

???

What if you're hiring for a technology you don't know?

We're hiring an Android developer right now and we don't have any
Android devs on our team.  We've asked these candidates to come in and
pair with us on a piece of work that they've already done.  At the very
least, we can find out how competent they are as a pair and a teacher.  

As a final step, we've gotten a recommendation for an experienced
Android consultant.  If we get a very senior candidate, this person can
help us hire with confidence as well as help us set salary expectations.

---

## Hiring a diverse team

???

This is something a lot of teams struggle with -- it's easily worthy of
its own talk.  Personally I feel constantly deluged by young white men
with no experience looking for an opportunity to prove themselves.

---

## The Rooney rule

???

A few years back the NFL noticed that its coaches were all white guys.
They implemented a rule that for any open head coaching position, a
minority candidate had to be considered.  Just having to interview a
minority candidate for each job has increased the number of minority
head coaches in the NFL to 22%.

What would 22% look like on your team?

Now, I know that this isn't easy.  You can't put out a job ad that says
"Latina C++ coder".  But you can move some of your recruiting
budget into sponsoring organizations of Latina and Latino coders.  Just
covering costs for a meetup and going out to say hello is the first step
in a relationship that could really transform your team.

If your team is lacking diversity, which it probably is in multiple
dimensions, pick an area of focus and do some outreach, until you can
confidently say that you are considering candidates from that
demographic for every open position.  There will be a lot more to do
after that, but it's a first step.

---

## False positives

???

Take the first 90 days seriously.

A new team member who doesn't work out causes serious stress for the
hiring manager and the team. 

Keep a close eye on their progress, via code review and verbal feedback
from colleagues, over the first 30 days.  By the end of that first month
you should know whether they are tracking ahead or behind your minimum
expectations.

At 30 days you should let them know where they stand and if anything
needs to change.  Handling these issues early lets the team know that
you will make sure they are working with the best people you can get.

---

## False negatives

???

I've definitely seen some folks fail the technical screen that I had
high hopes for.  Almost certainly, sometimes someone is just not having
their best day.  It's natural to want to give them another chance.

No interview process is perfect, and the information you are getting
from the process is mostly random facts that build up to create an
impression, and that impression is what you are judging when you decide
to move forward or not.  Never get this impression confused with the
person.

---

<img alt="excellent" src="images/excellent.jpg" height=400 width=400>


## Be excellent to each other

???

Always take the time to offer the
same kind of helpful feedback that you'd like to receive.

Your unsuccessful candidate inevitably has a promising career in technology and will probably be your interviewer one day.  

So do yourself a solid and be excellent to your candidates whenever
possible.
